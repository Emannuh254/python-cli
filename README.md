# Milk Collector System

_Author: Emmanuel Mutugi_

The Milk Collector System is a Python-based application designed to streamline the management of milk collection centers. It allows farmers to select their preferred milk collection center, submit reviews, and track milk production. Milk collectors can log milk deliveries, while regional directors can manage data and oversee performance across regions.

## Description

This project is built using **Python** and **SQL** to provide a comprehensive solution for managing milk collection centers. The system includes functionality for:

- **Farmers**: Select their preferred milk collection centers, leave reviews, and track their milk production.
- **Milk Collectors**: Log milk deliveries, monitor quantities, and update milk collection data.
- **Regional Directors**: Manage regional performance, filter data by region, and track the top-performing farmers.

The Milk Collector System is designed to improve the efficiency of milk collection operations and provide transparency in regional management.

## Features

- **Milk Delivery Logging**: Milk collectors can log milk deliveries, including quantity and date.
- **Regional Director Management**: Directors can filter data by region, view performance metrics, and oversee multiple collection centers.
- **Filtering**: Ability to filter the data based on region or top-performing farmers.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: The app runs in the terminal with a straightforward menu-driven interface for interacting with the system.

## How to Use

### Requirements

- A computer with Python 3.x installed
- Access to a terminal or command prompt
- A SQL database (configured using SQLite or any other SQL service)
- Basic understanding of Python and SQL

### Local Deployment

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **SQL**: The project uses SQL to store and retrieve data. SQLite is recommended for local development.

#### Installation Process

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [Your Repository Link]
   Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

bash
Copy code
cd milk-collector-system
Set up the database:
The system uses an SQLite database to manage farmers, collectors, and directors. You can configure the database by running the provided SQL scripts in the db/ folder or setting up your own database structure based on the provided instructions.

Install dependencies (if any required libraries are present):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Interact with the system via the command-line interface. The system will guide you through various menus for adding and managing farmers, collectors, and directors.

Basic Commands
Farmers Menu: View and manage farmers, add reviews, or delete entries.
Collectors Menu: Log milk deliveries, manage collector data.
Directors Menu: Oversee milk collection regions, view performance, and filter data.
Filter Menu: Filter data by region or top milk producers.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Core language used for backend logic and user interface.
SQL: Structured Query Language for managing data related to farmers, collectors, and directors.
SQLite (or other SQL databases): For storing and querying data in a relational database.
Python Libraries: sqlite3, os, and other Python libraries for handling database operations and menu navigation.
